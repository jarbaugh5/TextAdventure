TextAdventure
=============

A simple text game for the first Tufts Weekly Hack.
It's a short simulation of working on a class project, and/or working on a CS progect in general.
It's meant to be light hearted and quick so give it a shot!

How it works:

There is a runner, which accepts a 'story' object and then proceeds to run it. That's it. Enjoy! And take the code if you like.
